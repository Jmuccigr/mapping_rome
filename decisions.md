title: Decisions
---

- Keep multiple (repeated) references to the same place in the same text
- Provide location data for references to peoples.
    - E.g., "Veientines" becomes "Veii"
    - Type field becomes "People"
- Keep places in titles and descriptions
    - E.g., Keep "Samos" in "Pythagoras of Samos"
- Don't worry about generic references to places (e.g., "the city") as long as the place was already identified.
